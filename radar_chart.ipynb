    "For my project, I have developed a dashboard on Python that allows users to compare Statcast performance of metrics of MLB players for the ongoing MLB season.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data source for this project is BaseballSavant (baseballsavant.mlb.com). BaseballSavant is a data collection and visualization website put out by MLB. Unlike most traditional baseball statistic pages which focus on result-based metrics, BaseballSavant uniquely analyzes Statcast metrics, which focus on projected and expected metrics. Officially, according to MLB, Statcast is “a state-of-the-art tracking technology that allows for the collection and analysis of a massive amount of baseball data, in ways that were never possible in the past”. With cameras and radars now installed in every major league ballpark, Statcast can record metrics that cannot be quantified to the naked eye, such as the exit velocity of a batted ball, the sprint speed of a baserunner, or the spin rate of a pitch. With these new collection abilities, new metrics have been created that measure the raw performance of a player’s activities, such as expected metrics. In my project, I use these expected metrics (along with others) that are provided by BaseballSavant to look at the performance of MLB players. Along with this viewing of the individual player, I have created a radar that overlays these metrics for two players, allowing for direct comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "MLB player statistics are incredibly important to keep track of and help individuals with any type of stake in the game make decisions. With the number of statistics looked at, numbers can be hard to sort through and keep track of, as well as understand in a visually clear way. That is the purpose of the project, to create a visually clear and accurate display allowing individuals to search for any MLB player, see how they have performed using different metrics, and compare it to another player.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final product that allows an individual to search for any MLB players and see all their statistics displayed will be useful to many. General managers care about statistics when making decisions for roster construction and player evaluation. They can also see if a player is overvalued or undervalued, and make decisions in player development and trades. A coach may use this data in scouting and creating a game plan, as well as creating strategy, lineups, and making real-time game decisions. A player can use this data to understand their strengths and weaknesses, as well as evaluate their opponents. A sport better may have a large amount of money on the line and being able to quickly search for a player's on-base percentage, or batting average may be the difference in them winning or losing money, based on the decision they make. Overall, many individuals will benefit from this visual tool and make better-informed decisions.   "

    "Firstly, we need to import the necessary packages to extract the data from the BaseballSavant site.  For this we import the selenium package and its other attachments.  With these loaded in, I call selenium and then use the driver to open up the desired webpage which was specified with the URL.  After webdriver opens the webpage, we then specify which table we would like to extract data from and then have webdriver extract the desired information by specifying the rows Xpath.  After extracting this information, it is then stored in a list called data and we then close the webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important that we have a program which can webscrape BaseballSavant's content rather than just download a CSV file because a player's metrics change with each plate appearance they make.  Since baseball metrics are calculated on the aggregate, BaseballSavant updates their leaderboards daily, meaning we cannot download static data which does not represent accurate performances."

    "After loading the data into a list, we need to put it into a Pandas dataframe.  I specify the names of the desired columns and then load in the data in the list to rows in the dataframe.  After this, I have to do some cleaning of the data.  Firstly, the initial list 'data' contains some information about the games which are being played on the given day, which is not useful the the project.  I do not include this data by filtering out the list 'data' to include on the necessary statistics.  Also, since I am using another dataset to add more details in the visualization, I need to make sure the player names are identical in both the datasets.  Although I have removed all non-player instances in the data list, the player names are not in correct order, so I have to change it from last name, first name format into the desired format, which is first name then last name.  Also, there are some players in the BaseballSavant dataset which include name suffixes which aren't included in the MLBIDS dataset.  These instances are when players include titles such as 'Jr.' or 'III' which are only recognized by one of the datasets.  The names of these players are stored in the list 'bad_names'.  After we take account of these, we then create a new list called 'names' with the proper names, and then replace the initial 'Player' column with these correct values in a column called 'Names'.  We then drop the unecessary columns, 'Player' and 'index'.  After this, we then make sure the columns are in the desired order and are numeric types.  Then, we drop all rows which may have null values."

Being stored under the name 'final_proj_2023.csv', we can then retreive our file using a simple URL instead of having to load in our data using Selenium whenever we want to use the dataframe.  Although this project write up exists in just one Jupyter Notebook file, we originally had it in two files, one where the data was webscraped, uploaded, and stored in an AWS Bucket, and one where we would create our visualization.  With this, we could upload our data in the visualization file by using the bucket item URL.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now create our function to make our visualization.  For our inputs, we take two player names which we will use as our comparisons.  After taking these inputs, our function retreives these names from our BaseballSavant dataset.  Additionally, we are loading in our datasets: the BaseballSavant data as well as the MLB IDs dataset provided by Razzball, which we use so we can provide additional information about the player in our visualization, specifically their team and position.  The Razzball dataset is stored in an AWS bucket and is given a public URL, which we will use to access the data in our radar.  In order to make sure the names in the BaseballSavant and MLB IDs sets match, we are also doing some final cleaning.  As well as this, we make sure that if there are any N/A values in our BaseballSavant dataset, we replace them with the string 'missing'. With our names, we then extract their statistics and store them in a list called values.  We also make sure that we only put in the values which are present in the player's row.  After we have their stats, we then take then calculate the values that are in the 5th and 95th percentile for each metric we are looking at.  These values will be used as the ranges for each metric we observe.  We also create a list called params which is the names of all the metrics that will be plotted on the visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this we create a function called get_teampos, which retreives the player's team and position from the MLB IDs dataset.  However, there are some names in the dataset that still do not match those in the BaseballSavant set, so we have to specify those player names in the function creation to make sure they have their proper teams and positions.  After creating our function, we then call it on the player name and store their team and position in to variables.  With this, we are ready to begin creating the visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Radar function from mplsoccer, we load in the player values and the range values.  Additionally, we make sure our visualization knows that for K %, it is better to have a lower value than high value.  We also specify that we want 10 rings in our radar.  With our radar_inner function, we specify that we want our rings to be light grey.  With the rings_output function, we specify that we want the color of our first player's radar to be red and our second player to be blue, as well as wanting our visualization to be a comparison radar.  After this, we specify the font we want for our labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we add the titles for our visualization.  We set our main title as \"Statcast Comparison Radar for the 2023 MLB Season\".  We also set our endnote title, which credits the data as coming from BaseballSavant, lists who created the visualization, as well as adknowledging that the visualization is inspired by similar radars created by Statsbomb. Then, we but titles that display the player's name, team, and position.  The font color for these player specific titles are specified to be the same color as their radar chart. Lastly, we set the background color of the visualization"

We set the player1 and player2 variables as widget items, allowing for the user to select not only the specified players for the comparison chart, but use a drop down list to compare any two players in the entire dataset.  We do this by calling the interactive function on our created function 'comp' with the arguments for that function being the two widget items we just created.  After executing that cell, our radar chart is created."

    "## Radar Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "With our visualization, we a plotting hitting performance metrics onto a radar chart.  Put simply, the larger and more circular a player's radar chart looks, the better they are performing in our selected metrics.  With this comparison feature, a user can tell who is having the better season as a hitter, which answers our inital business question.  With this information, a general manager can compare two players who they may be interested in acquiring and determine who is better.  Coaches and those who set the lineups can also use this visualization to compare different batters they already have in their teams and decide who should play over another player.  Additionally, sports bettors can use this information and visualization to help inform their bets.  Also, since many of these metrics may not be common knowledge for even the average baseball fan, we have attached a glossary at the bottom of this file to help give specific interpretations and definitions for each metric mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, as of 4/16/23, the New York Yankees are dealing with a lot of injured players on their roster, specifically with their outfield, where two everyday starters in Giancarlo Stanton and Harrison Bader are unavailable to play.  With these holes in the current roster, their manager would have to choose players to step into their place and take over the starting position.  Two candidates for a starting spot are outfielders Franchy Cordero and Aaron Hicks.  If the manager of the Yankees, Aaron Boone, was having a difficult time choosing who to start between Cordero and Hicks, our visualization tool would be very helpful in projecting who would perform best.  Boone could choose to compare Hicks' and Cordero's metrics with our tool and see that Cordero is outperforming Hicks in nearly every metric and would likley be a more effective replacement for Stanton or Bader, as can be seen below:"
